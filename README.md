# RealTimeBusTracker
Now that you have gathered real-time bus data from the MBTA API, try adding it to a Google Map.
For this challenge, you will use the Google Maps API to display the live location of the buses on a map.
Using the google maps API I added markers for the buses traveling between the MIT and Harvard campus using MBTA API. I also added an infowindow identifying the bus number, the next stop and the occupancy.



Run:
copy index.html, mapanimation.js and styles.css into the same folder. Either drag index.html into the browser or right click and select open with using your preferred browser.

Roadmap of future improvements:
 I plan to add a toggle switch that will toggle between regular and night mode.
